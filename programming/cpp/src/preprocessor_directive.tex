\section{Pre-processor directives}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
Pre-processor directive always start with a '\texttt{\#}'.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\#include \textit{filename}}\\
    Replace with contents of \textit{filename}\\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item files with double quotes: \texttt{\# include "file.h"}\\
            First pre-processor looks for \texttt{file.h} in the same directory as the source file and then in pre-configured list of standard system directories.
        \item files with angle bracket: \texttt{\# include <stdio.h>}\\
            The pre-processor looks only in the pre-configured list of standard system directories.
        \item Additional directories can be include
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

    \item \texttt{\#define NAME \textit{replacement text}} \\
    \texttt{NAME} is replaced with \texttt{\textit{replacement text}} \\
    \item \texttt{\#define \textit{token}(arg1,arg2) \textit{statement}} \\
    Defining a macro. Eg: \\
    \texttt{\#define max(A,B) ((A) > (B) ? (A) : (B))}
    \item \texttt{\#undef NAME} \\
    Nullifies existing definition of \texttt{NAME}. Used to ensure a routine is a function.\\
    \item \texttt{\#if}, \texttt{\#elif},\texttt{\#else}, \texttt{\#endif}\\
    Eg-1:\\
    \texttt{\#if !define(HDR)}\\
    \texttt{\#define HDR}\\
    \texttt{/*contents of hrd.h*/}\\
    \texttt{\#endif}\\
    NOTE: \texttt{define()} after \texttt{\#if} returns \texttt{1} if its argument is already defined.\\ 
    Here \texttt{\#define HDR} is first line of \texttt{hrd.h} and this file is included only if it was not already included.
    Eg-2:\\
    \texttt{\#if SYSTEM == SYSV }\\
    \qquad \texttt{\#define HDR "sysv.h"}\\
    \texttt{\#elif SYSTEM == BSD}\\
    \qquad \texttt{\#define HDR "bsd.h"}\\
    \texttt{\#elif SYSTEM == MSDOS}\\
    \qquad \texttt{\#define HDR "msdos.h"}\\
    \texttt{\#else}\\
    \qquad \texttt{\#define HDR "default.h"}\\
    \texttt{\#endif}\\
    \item \texttt{\#ifdef}  and \texttt{\#ifndef}\\
    Test whether a name is already defined.\\
    Eg-1 in above point can be replaced by:
    \texttt{\#ifndef HDR}\\
    \texttt{\#define HDR}\\
    \texttt{/*contents of hdr.h*/ }\\
    \texttt{\#endif}\\
\end{itemize}
