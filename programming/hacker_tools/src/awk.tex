Eg: \texttt{PATH=\$PATH:\$HOME/scripts}\\

%\textcolor{blue}{NOTE: the above line could used in a terminal and the modification of PATH variable is valid only during the session, alternatively when it is used within a script the modification is valid only within the script and for example not in the terminal where the script is run.}\\

Next command tells git to use color to indicate changes.\\
\texttt{\$ git config --global color.ui true}\\
To change default text editor:\\
\texttt{\$ git config --global core.editor gedit}\\

Git consists of untracked files, tracked file , files staged for commit, and files committed to the repository. \\

\texttt{git commit} & Commits all staged files to repository. \texttt{--amend}\\
\texttt{-a} & This options tells git to automatically stage all modified tracked files in this commit.\\
\texttt{-m "..."} & Message is mandatory. If there is no message, git opens text editor to input message. Default text editor can be specified in git-config.\\
\texttt{git diff} & Shows difference between current version and staged version. If there are no staged version, shows difference between last commit and current versions.\\
\texttt{-- staged} & To see difference between staged version and last commit.\\
\texttt{git reset} & Unstage a file. Without a file name all staged files get unstaged.\\
\texttt{git log} & List all commits, commit message SHA-1 checksum etc. Options: \texttt{--pretty=oneline}, \texttt{--abbrev-commit}, \texttt{--graph}, \texttt{--branches}, \texttt{-n2} : to view only latest two commits.\\
\texttt{git rm} & Use these commands to rename or delete files.\\
\texttt{git mv} & Using rm and mv will confuse git.\\
\texttt{.gitignore} & Used to avoid certain files, fastq files for example, from being listed in untracked section of \texttt{git status}.\\
 & Eg: \texttt{\$ echo "*.fa" >> .gitignore}.\\
\texttt{git ls-tree} & List contents of tree object.\\
 & Use to list all files in the latest commit.\\
 & Eg: \texttt{git ls-tree -r master --name-only}\\

\texttt{git pull} & \texttt{git pull origin master}: simillar to above.\\
\hline\\

& \texttt{git branch -m \textit{old-branch} \textit{new-branch}}.\\
\texttt{--all} & To view hidden branches including remote repositories. For eg, \texttt{/remote/origin/master} is usually hidden. This functions like an actual branch but one cannot develop in this remote branch.\\
\texttt{git checkout} & To jump between branches. Use branch name that you want to jump to.\\
\texttt{git merge} & To merge two branches go to the branch you want to merge to and use \texttt{git merge <other branch>}. Merge conflict can be resolved as described earlier. In fact the earlier merge conflict was between a local branch and a remote branch.\\
\texttt{git push } & New branch from local can be synchronized with remote using: \texttt{git push origin branchname}.\\
\texttt{git fetch} & Used to synchronize my remote branch with remote remote repository. Eg: \texttt{git fetch origin}. To incoporate this to local branch use \texttt{git merge}.\\
